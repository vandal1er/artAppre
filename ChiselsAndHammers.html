Conceived in 1927 by the visionary sculptor Gutzon Borglum, this colossal sculpture adorns the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills near Keystone.

                <img src="NA2.jpg" alt="Post Image 1">
                <figcaption class="caption">This is actually made of bronze!</figcaption>
                <p>Standing as a beacon of freedom and democracy, the Statue of Liberty graces Liberty Island in the shimmering waters of New York Harbor, a symbol synonymous with the ideals of the United States. Designed by the esteemed French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, with the metal framework crafted by the renowned Gustave Eiffel, the colossal neoclassical sculpture was unveiled on October 28, 1886, as a gift from the people of France to the United States. Depicting Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty, the statue holds aloft a torch representing enlightenment, while her left hand carries a tablet inscribed with the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. At her feet lies a broken chain and shackle, symbolizing the abolition of slavery and the nation's commitment to freedom.<br>
                    <br>The genesis of the Statue of Liberty dates back to 1865, when French historian Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to celebrate the centennial of U.S. independence and the abolition of slavery. Despite initial setbacks, including the Franco-Prussian War, Bartholdi and his team persevered, with the completed statue's torch-bearing arm showcased at international expositions to garner support. Through the tireless efforts of individuals like Joseph Pulitzer, who spearheaded a fundraising campaign, the statue's pedestal was completed, and the monument was assembled on Bedloe's Island (now Liberty Island). Since its dedication, the Statue of Liberty has served as an enduring symbol of welcome to immigrants and a testament to the enduring values of freedom and democracy, attracting millions of visitors from around the globe to marvel at its grandeur and significance. Administered by the National Park Service since 1933, the statue remains a cherished icon and a testament to the enduring bonds between nations.</p>
